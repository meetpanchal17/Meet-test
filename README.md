Here’s a simple Python calculator you can build and run directly in your terminal. It supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division:

How it works:
- Prompts the user for two numbers and an operator.
- Performs the calculation based on the operator.
- Handles division by zero gracefully.
- Prints the result.
